Usage
=====

``pyscal`` is a both a command line tool and a Python API. The command
line tool is a short wrapper utilizing the underlying pyscal functionality.

The command line tool

Python API
----------

To generate SWOF input for Eclipse or flow (OPM) with certain
saturation endpoints and certain relative permeability endpoints, you
may run the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyscal import WaterOil
    wo = WaterOil(swl=0.05, sorw=0.03, h=0.1)
    wo.add_corey_water(nw=2.1, krwend=0.6)
    wo.add_corey_oil(now=2.5, kroend=0.9)
    wo.add_simple_J()
    print(wo.SWOF())

which will print a table that can be included in an Eclipse
simulation. There are more parameters to adjust, check the
corresponding API. Instead of Corey, you can find a corresponding
function for a LET-parametrization, or perhaps another capillary
pressure function. Also adjust the parameter ``h`` to obtain a finer
resolution on the saturation scale.

The output from the code above is:

.. code-block:: console

    -- swirr=0 swl=0.05 swcr=0.05 sorw=0.03

Instead of ``SWOF()``, you may ask for ``SWFN()`` or similar. Both
family 1 and 2 of Eclipse keywords are supported.  For the Nexus
simulator, you can use the function ``WOTABLE()``

Alternatively, it is possible to send all parameters for a SWOF curve
as a dictionary, through use of the ``PyscalFactory`` class. The
equivalent to the code lines above (except for capillary pressure) is then:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyscal import PyscalFactory
    params = dict(swl=0.05, sorw=0.03, h=0.1, nw=2.1, krwend=0.6, now=2.5, krowend=0.9, h=0.05)
    wo = PyscalFactory.create_water_oil(params)
    print(wo.SWOF())

Note that parameter names to factory functions are case *insensitive*, while
the ``add_*()`` parameters are not. This is becase the ``add_*()`` parameters
are meant as a Python API, while the factory class is there to aid
users when input is written in a different context, like an Excel
spreadsheet.

Also bear in mind that some API parameter names are ambiguous in the context of
the factory. ``kroend`` makes sense for ``WaterOil.add_corey_oil()`` but
is ambiguous in the factory where both water-oil and gas-oil are accounted for.
In the factory the names ``krowend`` and ``krogend`` must be used.

Similarly for the LET parameters, where `l` is valid for the low-level functions, while
in the factory context you must state `Lo`, `Lw`, `Lg` or `Log` (case-insensitive).

For visual inspection, there is a function ``.plotkrwkrow()`` which will
make a simple plot of the relative permeability curves using matplotlib.

Gas-oil curve
-------------

For a corresponding gas-oil curve, the API is analogous,

.. code-block:: python

    from pyscal import GasOil
    go = GasOil(swl=0.05, sorg=0.04)
    go.add_corey_gas(ng=1.2)
    go.add_corey_oil(nog=1.9)
    print(go.SGOF())

If you want to use your SGOF data together with a SWOF, it makes sense
to share some of the saturation endpoints, as there are compatibility constraints.
For this reason, it is recommended to initialize both the ``WaterOil`` and ``GasOil``
objects trough a ``WaterOilGas`` object.

There is a corresponding ``PyscalFactory.create_gas_oil()`` support function with
dictionary as argument.

For plotting, ``GasOil`` object has a function ``.plotkrgkrog()``.


Water-oil-gas
-------------

For three-phase, saturation endpoints must match to make sense in a reservoir simualation.
The ``WaterOilGas`` object acts as a container for both a ``WaterOil`` object and a ``GasOil``
object to aid in consistency. Saturation endpoints is only input once during initialization.

Typical usage could be:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyscal import WaterOilGas

    wog = WaterOilGas(swl=0.05, sorg=0.04, sorw=0.03)
    wog.wateroil.add_corey_water()
    wog.wateroil.add_corey_oil()
    wog.gasoil.add_corey_gas()
    wog.gasoil.add_corey_water()

As seen in the example, the object members ``wateroil`` and ``gasoil`` are ``WaterOil`` and ``GasOil`` objects
having been initialized by the ``WaterOilGas`` initialization.

Alternatively, there is a
The ``WaterOilGas`` objects can write ``SWOF`` tables (which is directly delegated to the ``WaterOil`` object, but
it can also write a ``SOF3`` table.

A method ``.selfcheck()`` can be run on the object to determine if there are any known consistency issues (which would
crash a reservoir simulator) with the tabulated data.


Interpolation in a SCAL recommendation
--------------------------------------

A SCAL recommendation in this context is nothing but a container
of three ``WaterOilGas`` objects, representing a `low`, a `base` and a
`high` case. The prime use case for this container is the ability
to interpolate between the low and high case.

An interpolation parameter at `-1` returns the low case, `0` returns the
base case and `1` returns the high case. Optionally, a separate
interpolation parameter can be used for the ``GasOil`` interpolation
if they are believed to be independent.

SCAL recommendations are initialized from three distinct
``WaterOilGas`` objects, which are then recommended constructed using
the corresponding factory method.

.. code-block:: python

    from pyscal import SCALrecommendation, PyscalFactory

    low = PyscalFactory.create_water_oil_gas(dict(nw=1, now=1, ng=1, nog=1, tag='low'))
    base = PyscalFactory.create_water_oil_gas(dict(nw=2, now=2, ng=2, nog=3, tag='base'))
    high = PyscalFactory.create_water_oil_gas(dict(nw=3, now=3, ng=3, nog=3, tag='high'))
    rec = SCALrecommendation(low, base, high)

    interpolant = rec.interpolate(-0.4)

    print(interpolant.SWOF())
