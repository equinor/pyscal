Usage
=====

``pyscal`` is a both a command line tool and a Python API. The command
line tool is a short wrapper utilizing the underlying pyscal functionality.

The command line tool
---------------------

.. argparse::
    :ref: pyscal.pyscalcli.get_parser
    :prog: pyscal

An example input table could look like:

For SCAL recommendation where the intention is to interpolate between a pessimistic,
through a base case and to a optimistic curve set, this is accomplished
by having three rows for each SATNUM, and a column called CASE which contains
the strings 'pessimistic', 'base' and 'optimistic' (also possible is
'low', 'high', 'opt' and 'pess'. 'low' is identical to 'pessimistic' always and
vice versa. An example table could be

======= ===== ====== ======
 SATNUM CASE     nw   etc..
======= ===== ====== ======
      1 low      2.1    ..
      1 base     1.8    ..
      1 high     1.5    ..
      2 pess     2.4    ..
      2 base     1.9    ..
      2 opt      1.2    ..
======= ===== ====== ======

The values in the CASE column are also case-insensitive. Remember to always
supply interpolation parameters to the command line client whenever the
data set contains a CASE column.

Saturation and relative permeability endpoints
----------------------------------------------

The endpoints used in the parametrization. These parameters usually
correspond to API argument names for WaterOil, OilGas and GasWater objects,
where they must be given in lower-case version. When provided through
PyscalFactory (xlsx or csv input), the parameter are case-insensitive.

Water-Oil
^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/wateroil-endpoints.png
    :width: 600

*Note*: Pyscal prior to 0.6.0 had the oil relperm anchord at swcr, and then used the
parameters krowend and krowmax. krowmax is now deprecated, and krowend and krogend must be
equal and renamed to kroend.

When initialized through xlsx/csv (through PyscalFactory) a parameter called
``swcr_add`` is available. If ``swcr_add`` is provided, ``swcr`` will be
calculated as ``swl`` plus this delta value.

Gas-Oil
^^^^^^^

For GasOil, there is an option of where to anchor ``krgend``, shown in the following figure.
The red curve is the default, where ``krgendanchor=="sorg"``, and the pink is the other choice.

Gas-Water

Capillary pressure
------------------

Capillary pressures can be added to the saturation tables through additional
parameters. The formulas for capillary pressure are evaluated on a saturation
parameter normalized in the interval [*swirr*, 1], as opposed to the normalized
saturation used for relative permeability.

Supported capillary pressure parametrizations are

 1. :func:`Simple J <pyscal.wateroil.WaterOil.add_simple_J>`,
    "RMS" version of the coefficients *a* and *b*.
    Required parameters:  ``a``, ``b``, ``poro_ref``, ``perm_ref``, ``drho``.
 2. :func:`Simple J, petrophysical version <pyscal.wateroil.WaterOil.add_simple_J_petro>`,
    different definition of *a* and *b*
    compared to simple J.
    Required parameters:  ``a_petro``, ``b_petro``, ``poro_ref``, ``perm_ref``, ``drho``.
 3. :func:`Normalized J <pyscal.wateroil.WaterOil.add_normalized_J>`,
    different definition of *a* and *b*
    Required parameters:  ``a``, ``b``, ``sigma_costau``.
 4. :func:`Skjæveland correlation <pyscal.wateroil.WaterOil.add_skjaeveland_pc>`
 5. :func:`LET primary drainage <pyscal.wateroil.WaterOil.add_LET_pc_pd>`
 6. :func:`LET imbibition <pyscal.wateroil.WaterOil.add_LET_pc_imb>`

Only the three first are available when initializing through xlsx/csv input on
the command line. Each parametrization is then triggered by the presence of the
listed required parametrers.  For the last three a custom Python code utilizing
the API must be written.

Additionally, *g* can be given as the gravitational acceleration where relevant,
otherwise defaulted to 9.81 m/s².

For *simple J*, it is also possible to initialize *swl* from a height above free
water level, by providing ``swlheight`` (in meters) as a parameter instead of
``swl``. In that case, it is also recommended to use ``swcr_add`` instead of
``swcr``.

GasWater objects support the simple J and its petrophysical version.

There is currently no support functions for adding capillary pressure to GasOil
objects, but it is possible to modify the ``pc`` column of the ``gasoil.table``
dataframe property and it will be included in the output.

Python API examples
-------------------

Water-oil curve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To generate SWOF input for Eclipse or flow (OPM) with certain
saturation endpoints and certain relative permeability endpoints, you
may run the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyscal import WaterOil
    wo = WaterOil(swl=0.05, sorw=0.03, h=0.1, tag="Foobarites")
    wo.add_corey_water(nw=2.1, krwend=0.6)
    wo.add_corey_oil(now=2.5, kroend=0.9)
    wo.add_simple_J()
    print(wo.SWOF())

which will print a table that can be included in an Eclipse
simulation. There are more parameters to adjust, check the
corresponding API. Instead of Corey, you can find a corresponding
function for a LET-parametrization, or perhaps another capillary
pressure function. Also adjust the parameter ``h`` to obtain a finer
resolution on the saturation scale.

The output from the code above is:

.. code-block:: console

    SWOF
    -- Foobarites
    -- pyscal: 0.7.x
    -- swirr=0 swl=0.05 swcr=0.05 sorw=0.03

    /


Instead of ``SWOF()``, you may ask for ``SWFN()`` or similar. Both
family 1 and 2 of Eclipse keywords are supported.  For the Nexus
simulator, you can use the function ``WOTABLE()``

Alternatively, it is possible to send all parameters for a SWOF curve
as a dictionary, through use of the ``PyscalFactory`` class. The
equivalent to the code lines above (except for capillary pressure) is then:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyscal import PyscalFactory
    params = dict(swl=0.05, sorw=0.03, h=0.1, nw=2.1, krwend=0.6,
                  now=2.5, kroend=0.9, tag="Foobarites")
    wo = PyscalFactory.create_water_oil(params)
    print(wo.SWOF())

Note that parameter names to factory functions are case *insensitive*, while
the ``add_*()`` parameters are not. This is becase the ``add_*()`` parameters
are meant as a Python API, while the factory class is there to aid
users when input is written in a different context, like an Excel
spreadsheet.

Also bear in mind that some API parameter names are ambiguous in the context of
the factory. ``kroend`` makes sense for ``WaterOil.add_corey_oil()`` but
is ambiguous in the factory where both water-oil and gas-oil are accounted for.
In the factory the names ``krowend`` and ``krogend`` must be used.

Similarly for the LET parameters, where `l` is valid for the low-level
functions, while in the factory context you must state `Lo`, `Lw`, `Lg` or `Log`
(case-insensitive).

For visual inspection, there is a function ``.plotkrwkrow()`` which will
make a simple plot of the relative permeability curves using matplotlib.

Gas-oil curve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a corresponding gas-oil curve, the API is analogous,

.. code-block:: python

    from pyscal import GasOil
    go = GasOil(swl=0.05, sorg=0.04)
    go.add_corey_gas(ng=1.2)
    go.add_corey_oil(nog=1.9)
    print(go.SGOF())

If you want to use your SGOF data together with a SWOF, it makes sense to share
some of the saturation endpoints, as there are compatibility constraints.  For
this reason, it is recommended to initialize both the ``WaterOil`` and
``GasOil`` objects trough a ``WaterOilGas`` object.

There is a corresponding ``PyscalFactory.create_gas_oil()`` support function with
dictionary as argument.

For plotting, ``GasOil`` object has a function ``.plotkrgkrog()``.

Gas-Water curve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two-phase gas-water is similar, with typical usage:

.. code-block:: python

   from pyscal import GasWater

   gw = GasWater(swl=0.05, sgrw=0.1, sgcr=0.2)
   gw.add_corey_water()
   gw.add_corey_gas()

A GasWater object can export family 2 keywords, ``SWFN`` and ``SGFN``.

Water-oil-gas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For three-phase, saturation endpoints must match to make sense in a reservoir
simulation.  The ``WaterOilGas`` object acts as a container for both a
``WaterOil`` object and a ``GasOil`` object to aid in consistency. Saturation
endpoints is only input once during initialization.

Typical usage could be:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyscal import WaterOilGas

    wog = WaterOilGas(swl=0.05, sorg=0.04, sorw=0.03)
    wog.wateroil.add_corey_water()
    wog.wateroil.add_corey_oil()
    wog.gasoil.add_corey_gas()
    wog.gasoil.add_corey_water()

As seen in the example, the object members ``wateroil`` and ``gasoil`` are
``WaterOil`` and ``GasOil`` objects having been initialized by the
``WaterOilGas`` initialization.

The ``WaterOilGas`` objects can write ``SWOF`` tables or ``SOF3`` tables.

A method ``.selfcheck()`` can be run on the object to determine if there are any
known consistency issues (which would crash a reservoir simulator) with the
tabulated data, this is by default run on every output attempt.

Interpolation in a SCAL recommendation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A SCAL recommendation in this context is nothing but a container
of three ``WaterOilGas`` objects, representing a `low`, a `base` and a
`high` case. The prime use case for this container is the ability
to interpolate between the low and high case.

An interpolation parameter at `-1` returns the low case, `0` returns the
base case and `1` returns the high case. Optionally, a separate
interpolation parameter can be used for the ``GasOil`` interpolation
if they are believed to be independent.

SCAL recommendations are initialized from three distinct
``WaterOilGas`` objects, which are then recommended constructed using
the corresponding factory method.

For two-phase water-oil setups, WaterOilGas objects are still used
in the SCAL recommendation object with an empty GasOil reference. For gas-water,
the SCAL recommendation holds three GasWater objects, but works similarly.

.. code-block:: python

    from pyscal import SCALrecommendation, PyscalFactory

    low = PyscalFactory.create_water_oil_gas(dict(nw=1, now=1, ng=1, nog=1, tag='low'))
    base = PyscalFactory.create_water_oil_gas(dict(nw=2, now=2, ng=2, nog=3, tag='base'))
    high = PyscalFactory.create_water_oil_gas(dict(nw=3, now=3, ng=3, nog=3, tag='high'))
    rec = SCALrecommendation(low, base, high)

    interpolant = rec.interpolate(-0.4)

    print(interpolant.SWOF())
